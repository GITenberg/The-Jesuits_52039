<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p. v</span>PREFACE
TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first edition of the following
pages was prepared as a Lecture for the Islington Protestant
Institute.&nbsp; The delivery of that Lecture has led to a more
careful study of the subject, so that in this second edition
there is a considerable quantity of additional information, which
I trust may be found important.</p>
<p>One gentleman has done me the honour of noticing the first
edition, and publishing a pamphlet in order to show that the
constitution quoted on page 32 should be rendered as the reader
will find it there.&nbsp; It is a matter of great regret to me
that he should have thought it right to say of the remainder of
the lecture, that &ldquo;statements which few surely can believe,
will, he trusts, produce in the minds of readers an effect the
very reverse of that intended.&rdquo;&nbsp; If he had pointed out
any inaccuracy, I should have been only too happy to correct it;
and any proof of error on my part would have been much more
satisfactory to his readers than a general and unsupported
insinuation.&nbsp; <a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>In the present edition he will find, I believe, a clear
reference to every important extract; and abundant opportunity is
afforded him, if possible, to disprove my statements.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">GENERAL OBJECT AND
ORGANIZATION.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the various human
combinations that have ever risen to adorn or to disgrace
humanity, the Society of the Jesuits is perhaps the most
remarkable.&nbsp; The great men of the world have constructed
mighty schemes for its government, and the utmost powers of the
human mind have again and again been called out in order to
combine men for the attainment of some given end; but of all
these varied schemes, I believe it may be safely affirmed that
there never yet has been known one so admirably suited to its
end, so beautifully adjusted in its parts, so wonderfully adapted
to the real condition of society, or possessing so extraordinary
a capability of applying its movements, so as to meet the ways
and wishes of all those countless characters upon whom its action
is employed.&nbsp; The question whether such an institution is a
curse or a blessing to the human race must, of <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>course, depend
on two things, viz., the object to which its efforts are
directed, and the principles by which they are controlled.&nbsp;
If that object be the honour of the Lord Jesus Christ, and if
those principles be in harmony with the Word of God, then,
clearly, so varied and effective an instrumentality must act most
powerfully for the benefit of man; but if, on the other hand, its
object be to pervert the truth and impede its progress,&mdash;if,
again, the principles of its action be flatly opposed, not merely
to the Word of God, but also to the most elementary maxims of
even natural morality,&mdash;then it is equally clear that the
perfection of the instrument merely adds to its fatal power, and
just in proportion to the completeness of the machinery will be
the deadliness of the blight which it will produce upon
society.</p>
<p>Now the avowed object of the Order of Jesuits is the support
of the See of Rome.&nbsp; In the original plan submitted by
Loyola to Pope Paul III. it was stated, &ldquo;The Society of
Jesus shall constitute a trained host, ready at all times to
fight for God&rsquo;s vicegerent, the holy Roman Father, and for
the Roman Catholic Church, in which alone is
salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; To this declaration of their original
designs, the Society has to this day avowedly adhered; and
although their countless intrigues against the other Orders have
shown very clearly that, in professing to serve the Pope, they
have had an ulterior end, viz., the aggrandizement and exaltation
of their own Order, yet we must always regard this as their
professed design, <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>and form our estimate of the object of the Society by our
estimate of the value of the Popedom.&nbsp; There are, alas,
those who, trying it by this test, would pronounce its object
good; but, thanks be to God! there is, I verily believe, a vast,
and vastly increasing, multitude who have been driven by recent
events to bring Popery to the test of Scripture, and who have
risen from the study with the deep and indelible conviction that,
instead of being our Lord&rsquo;s vicegerent, the Pope of Rome is
the usurper of his sovereignty; and that, therefore, if this be
the object of Jesuitism, Jesuitism must be bad; and if this be
the end of its action, the better its machinery the worse its
effects upon the world.</p>
<p>The full principles of the Society it is extremely difficult
to discover or to describe, inasmuch as there appears to be a
very wide difference between the system as exhibited in its
public documents and as carried out in the practice of its
members.&nbsp; There are countless facts in the history of the
order which prove conclusively that there is one code for the
world to look at, and another for the world to feel; a uniform
for inspection days, and a plain dress for common life.&nbsp; The
constitutions and other acknowledged documents are open to the
world, but if we want to know how the Jesuit will act when he has
secretly wormed his way into the confidence of our family, or to
discover any real moral principle by which the conduct of such an
one will be guided, I believe that we shall be utterly at a
loss.&nbsp; He has his own secret <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>instructions from his superiors, and
what they are will probably be never known out of the Order, till
the great day shall come when the secrets of all hearts shall be
made known.</p>
<p>We must be content, therefore, with only superficial
information upon the subject; but there is enough in the
undoubted avowals of the Society to amaze the conscience of any
honest mind.&nbsp; It is true that we are able to examine merely
its authorized documents as prepared to meet the world&rsquo;s
eye, and that when we have been through them all we shall know
but a fragment of the system; but at the same time we shall learn
enough to discover that, in order to the attainment of its
object, the Society is prepared to set aside all the dictates
either of conscience or of Scripture; and we shall also obtain
ample evidence to convict the Church of Rome of the awful guilt
of abandoning honesty in order to secure power, and of
sacrificing moral virtue in order to attain supreme dominion.</p>
<h3>ORGANIZATION.</h3>
<p>The Members of the Society are arranged in the following
classes:&mdash;<a name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"
class="citation">[10]</a></p>
<p>The Professed, who, in fact, constitute the real body of the
Order.&nbsp; The property of the Society is vested in them, and
they only have a right to attend a general congregation, or to
vote at the election of a General.&nbsp; They are all priests,
and none are admitted till the age <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>of twenty-five.&nbsp; They are
distinguished from the other classes by having taken four instead
of three vows, the rest having vowed three things, viz.,
obedience, poverty, and chastity, but the professed having added
a fourth promise, viz., absolute obedience to the Pope, as the
Vicar of Christ.</p>
<p>Spiritual Coadjutors, whose office is to assist the professed
in spiritual things; such as preaching, hearing confessions,
superintending Colleges, &amp;c.&nbsp; These, likewise, must all
be priests.</p>
<p>Secular Coadjutors.&nbsp; These are all laymen, and their
office is to fill such secular offices as may be required, in
order to promote the objects of the Society.&nbsp; They act as
servants and inferior officers in the Colleges and other houses;
but they are employed, when qualified, for higher and more
important duties. <a name="citation11a"></a><a
href="#footnote11a" class="citation">[11a]</a>&nbsp; They are
expected also to influence their neighbours by conversation and
other means. <a name="citation11b"></a><a href="#footnote11b"
class="citation">[11b]</a>&nbsp; They are drawn from all ranks,
some being unable to read, and others educated men. <a
name="citation11c"></a><a href="#footnote11c"
class="citation">[11c]</a>&nbsp; It is clear that this class must
supply the Society with one of the most effective of its
agencies.&nbsp; The lay coadjutor may act in any capacity, as a
merchant, statesman, mechanic, or anything else which his
Superior may deem expedient, and may thus secure a powerful
influence without any person having the least idea that a Jesuit
is in his neighbourhood.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>Approved scholars, or those youths who have been
selected as likely to prove suitable for the future purposes of
the Society, and are being trained in Jesuit Colleges.&nbsp;
Although their education is not yet complete, these scholars have
been required to take the three vows, and moreover to add the
promise that they will be ready, when required, to devote
themselves to the service of the Society.</p>
<p>Those whose future rank is not yet decided, but who are
admitted upon the condition that they shall be employed in
whatever way the Society shall deem most suited to their
talents.</p>
<p>To this list Mr. Duller adds another class, which he terms
affiliated members, or adjuncts, which he states includes even
ladies. <a name="citation12a"></a><a href="#footnote12a"
class="citation">[12a]</a>&nbsp; From his account they appear to
be bound to the Order by a compact that on their part they will
act as spies and agents in all their intercourse with those
amongst whom they dwell, while the Society undertakes in return
to guarantee to them a share in all those spiritual privileges
which, as it vainly pretends, it is the Jesuits&rsquo;
prerogative to bestow. <a name="citation12b"></a><a
href="#footnote12b" class="citation">[12b]</a>&nbsp; The effect
of these <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>affiliated members and lay coadjutors is, of course,
enormous.&nbsp; They are like the thin fibres to the root,
through whose power the whole plant is nourished.&nbsp; They
impart to the Order an ever-penetrating power.&nbsp; They enable
it to act without awakening the least suspicion of its presence,
to worm its way into the very heart of Protestantism, and to
secure the unsuspecting confidence of those whom they desire to
betray and ruin.</p>
<p>These different classes are all subject to the absolute and
uncontrolled authority of the General.&nbsp; This important
officer is elected for life by a general assembly of the
professed members.&nbsp; He resides at Rome, and is assisted by a
small council, consisting of a certain number of assistants, and
elected representatives from the different provinces.&nbsp; The
whole world is divided into districts, over each of which one
assistant is appointed to preside; these districts are again
subdivided into &ldquo;Provinces,&rdquo; with a Provincial at the
head of each, appointed by the General for a given time, and
these provinces contain their houses for the professed, with a
Provost at the head of each, their novice-houses, colleges,
seminaries, and, in Protestant-lands, mission-houses, where their
agents live unnoticed as secular clergy.&nbsp; There is
therefore, throughout, the most complete system of graduated
authority.&nbsp; Every Jesuit has over him a certain officer, to
whose authority he is absolutely subject; and the connexion is so
perfect, that the command of the General strikes without <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>fail, like an
electric shock, to the most distant individual in the
Order.&nbsp; The Provincial or the Provost is just as much under
authority as the priest or the novice; and there is the same law
of unquestioning submission in all the ranks and complex
ramifications of the Society; the result of which is, that the
General has at his command a devoted and well-compacted army,
quartered discreetly in every nation of the known world, and
ready at any moment to execute his designs.&nbsp; The same
arrangements are equally effective in supplying the General with
information.&nbsp; The Provincials and other officers are all
required to send full reports of their several districts to
head-quarters.&nbsp; The characters, acquirements, dispositions,
successes, failures, and, in certain cases, even the confessions
of the members are registered and reported.&nbsp; Nothing of
importance can occur in the most distant outpost, without the
report of it being forwarded to Rome; and if it tends to throw
light on the qualifications of any member of the Order, it is
recorded against his name, so as to supply the General with a
bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the leading points in the character of
every individual under his command.</p>
<h2><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PLAN OF ACTION.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">With</span> such an organization at his
command, it is clear that the General can rarely be at a loss for
agency.&nbsp; Whatever be the required service, it is an easy
thing to select the best adapted instrument, and to despatch him
without delay.</p>
<p>But to describe their mode of action is almost impossible, for
it varies with every circumstance, and is different in every
locality.</p>
<p>When they are permitted to locate themselves in any country,
their two chief means for the attainment of their object appear
to be, education and the confessional.&nbsp; They will then go
boldly forth, generally two and two, in the long black cloak,
with which I grieve to say our English eye is becoming too
familiar.&nbsp; They will publicly found their seminaries and
colleges, supplying them with first-rate professors, so securing
to themselves the early education of the great majority of the
rising generation.&nbsp; It is stated, that in France the
colleges and educational establishments have been all turned over
to them by the Government of Louis Napoleon. <a
name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a></p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>The
second, and most influential avowed method of securing influence
has always been the confessional.&nbsp; For this, the Jesuit
priest is carefully instructed at the time of his profession, and
by it he wields, of course, an almost unbounded power.&nbsp; The
great aim is to obtain the office of confessor to kings,
statesmen, and men of influence; and it is stated, that before
their suppression, they had thus secured the ear and conscience
of almost every Roman Catholic king in Europe.&nbsp; It is very
fearful to contemplate the course of conduct by which this
influence has been attained.&nbsp; The confessional is bad enough
at all times; but what must be its effect, when the priest is
instructed, instead of checking sin, to adapt his treatment to
the inclinations and vices of his penitent?&nbsp; But this has
always been the charge urged against the Jesuits.&nbsp; Pascal
charges them most powerfully with lowering down the maxims of the
Gospel, so as to accommodate them to the maxims of the
world.&nbsp; He represents the Jesuit priest as saying, &ldquo;We
are forced to allow some liberty, because men are at present so
corrupted, that, being unable to make men come to us, we are
obliged to go to them.&nbsp; It is to hold them fast, that our
casuits have taken into consideration the vices to which a person
is most exposed in all stations, so as to establish mild maxims,
without affecting truth, with which it would be difficult not to
be content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The charge of Pascal has been completely verified, <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>by the
discovery of the &ldquo;Secreta Monita,&rdquo; or private manual
of the Jesuit Confessor.&nbsp; Of course the authenticity of this
remarkable book has been denied; for the Jesuit, as we shall soon
learn, can deny anything; but yet it has been found in so many
independent Jesuit institutions, that it is almost impossible to
doubt the evidence of its authenticity.&nbsp; In these secret
instructions may be found such passages as the
following:&mdash;&ldquo;Princes and distinguished persons must by
all means be so managed, that they (the Jesuits) may gain their
ear, which will easily secure their hearts . . .&nbsp; Since
ecclesiastics secure the greatest favour, by winking at the vices
of the great, as in the case of incestuous marriages, &amp;c.,
such persons must be led to hope, that through their aid, a
dispensation may be obtained from the Pope, which he will no
doubt readily grant,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; Again, &ldquo;Their
confessors must allow greater latitude than those of other
orders, in order that their penitents, being allured by such
freedom, may relinquish others, and entirely depend on their
direction and advice.&rdquo; <a name="citation17"></a><a
href="#footnote17" class="citation">[17]</a></p>
<p>By such awful practices have they sought to secure the ear of
the great in the confessional; nor can we wonder if a power so
gained is used in many cases for the foulest purposes.&nbsp;
Duller asserts that the confessions of sovereign princes are at
all times communicated to the General, and something nearly
approaching to this is directed in <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>the ordinances of the Society, where
it is said that &ldquo;the confessors of princes should consult
with their Superiors in doubtful cases,&rdquo; <a
name="citation18a"></a><a href="#footnote18a"
class="citation">[18a]</a> a regulation which, of course, enables
them to lay anything they please before the General.&nbsp; The
use made of the information, when obtained, may be gathered from
the &ldquo;Secreta Monita,&rdquo; where, amongst other similar
passages, it is said, &ldquo;The Society will contribute much to
its own advantage by fomenting and heightening (but with caution
and secresy) the animosities that arise amongst princes and great
men, in order that they may weaken each other.&rdquo; <a
name="citation18b"></a><a href="#footnote18b"
class="citation">[18b]</a>&nbsp; Such are the maxims of this
professedly Christian institution, which claims to be
pre-eminently devoted to the service of God, and even calls
itself the &ldquo;Society of Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is it possible
to imagine a more flagrant insult to that holy name by which we
live?</p>
<p>But the Jesuit does not depend on any open agency alone: and
he is the most dangerous when the long cloak is laid aside, and
there is nothing apparent to distinguish him from ordinary
men.&nbsp; Then it is that he can secretly worm his way into the
confidence of a wholly unsuspecting public.&nbsp; It was stated
by Mr. Sheil, in the House of Commons, that there were swarms of
Jesuits in England.&nbsp; But who has seen them? and who has been
conscious of their presence?&nbsp; It is asserted by different
historians, that they even fought in Cromwell&rsquo;s army; <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>and, in order
to gain their object, assumed the garb of rigid Puritans. <a
name="citation19a"></a><a href="#footnote19a"
class="citation">[19a]</a>&nbsp; Their principles render any such
deception probable, as will be seen when we proceed to
investigate their morality.&nbsp; It will then appear, that there
is nothing in their conscientious scruples to prevent their
assuming any character, or personating any principles.&nbsp;
Their object is to insinuate themselves amongst their opponents,
like the fluid soaking into the flax, and then, when the time is
come, to blow up the whole, and split into a thousand shreds the
strong and well-compacted fibres.&nbsp; In the pursuit of such
ends they appear to be bound by no oaths, and to be regardless of
all legislation but their own.&nbsp; They can fight on both sides
in the same engagement; some in the army of the Cavaliers, and
some under Cromwell amongst the Roundheads.&nbsp; They may sign
the Articles, though they do not believe them; and even bear the
sacred office of the ministry, although their only object is to
betray the Church.&nbsp; One man may empty the parish church by
disgusting the people with Romish ceremonial; <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>while his
brother breaks up the Dissenting congregation by the artful
revival of some forgotten grudge.&nbsp; They can mix with the
Anti-State-Church League in a crusade against establishments, and
then give their right hand to the exclusive Churchman, and join
with him in railing against Dissent.&nbsp; They can stir up the
Voluntaries, by exciting their horror against the iniquity of
State patronage, and the evil of endowments, while at the same
moment they are sneaking down to Downing-street, and there
whispering into the ear of the Minister, that it is essential to
Ireland&rsquo;s prosperity that an endowment be voted for
Maynooth.&nbsp; In short, wherever there is truth to be assailed
or friends to be separated&mdash;wherever there is the slightest
hope of strengthening the Company, by weakening existing forces
or breaking up existing ties&mdash;wherever there is a prospect
of turning aside an honest man by the insinuating suggestions of
a subtle friend,&mdash;there is the sphere for the unhallowed
agency of Loyola&rsquo;s disciples. <a name="citation20"></a><a
href="#footnote20" class="citation">[20]</a></p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>Thus
the steps of the Company have always been traceable by the
disunion, the intrigues, the plots and counterplots, the
factions, and separations which have invariably sprung up under
their influence.&nbsp; I am anxious to state nothing that I
cannot prove; and, therefore, having made this assertion, I will
conclude this portion of the subject by calling one witness,
whose testimony will be admitted, at all events, by
Romanists.&nbsp; It shall be none other than the infallible head
of the infallible Church&mdash;none other than the Pope
himself.&nbsp; Pope Clement XIV. thought little better of the
Jesuits than we do; and on July 21, 1773, he issued a Bull, of
which the following passages are extracts:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We have seen with the grief of our heart
that neither these remedies, nor an infinity of others since
employed, have produced their due effects, or silenced the
accusations and complaints against the said Society.&nbsp; Our
predecessors, Urban VII., Clement IX., &amp;c., &amp;c.,
employed, without effect, all their efforts to the same
purpose.&nbsp; In vain did they endeavour, by salutary
constitutions, to restore peace to the Church, as well with
respect to secular affairs, with which the Company ought not to
have interfered, as with regard to the Missions, which gave rise
to great disputes and oppositions, on the part of the Company,
with the ordinaries, with other religious <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>Orders, about
the holy places and communities of all sorts in Europe, Africa,
and America, to the great loss of souls, and great scandal of the
people; as, likewise, concerning the meaning and practice of
certain idolatrous ceremonies, adopted in certain places in
contempt of those justly approved by the Catholic Church; and
further, concerning the use and exposition of certain maxims
which the Holy See has with reason proscribed, as scandalous and
manifestly contrary to good morals; and, lastly, concerning other
matters of great importance and prime necessity towards
preserving the integrity and purity of the doctrines of the
Gospel, from which maxims have resulted very great inconveniences
and great detriment, both in our days and in past ages, such as
the revolts and intestine troubles in some of the cathedral
States, persecutions against the Church, &amp;c. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;After so many storms, troubles, divisions, every good
man looked forward with impatience to the happy day which was to
restore peace and tranquillity.&nbsp; But under the reign of
Clement XIII., the times became more difficult and tempestuous,
complaints and quarrels were multiplied on every side, in some
places dangerous seditions arose, tumults, discord, dissensions,
scandals, which, weakening or entirely breaking the bands of
Christian charity, excited the faithful to all the rage of party
hatreds and enmities.&nbsp; Desolation and danger grew to such a
height, that the very sovereigns whose piety and <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>liberality
towards the Company were so well known as to be looked on as
hereditary in their families,&mdash;we mean our dearly-beloved
sons in Christ, the Kings of France, Spain, Portugal, and
Sicily,&mdash;found themselves reduced to the necessity of
expelling and driving from their states, kingdoms, and provinces
these very companions of Jesus, persuaded that there remained no
other remedy to so great evils, and that this step was necessary
in order to prevent the Christians from rising one against
another, and from massacring each other in the very bosom of our
common mother, the Holy Church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actuated by so many and important considerations, . . .
after a mature deliberation, we do, out of our certain knowledge,
and the fulness of our apostolic power, suppress and abolish the
said Company.&nbsp; We deprive it of all activity whatever, of
its houses, schools, colleges, hospitals, lands, and, in short,
every other place belonging to the said Company in any manner
whatever, in whatsoever kingdom or province they may be
situated.&nbsp; We abrogate and annul its statutes, rules,
customs, decrees, and constitutions, even though confirmed by
oath and approved by the Holy See, or otherwise; we declare all
and every kind of authority, the General, the Provincial, the
Visitor, and other superiors of the said Society, to be annulled
and abolished for ever, of whatsoever nature the said authority
may be, as well in things spiritual as temporal,&rdquo;

<span class="GutSmall">THE CONNECTING TIE.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Such</span> being the organization and
plan of action of this mysterious Society, the next subject for
inquiry is, the connecting principle of its vast machinery.&nbsp;
This may be briefly stated to be, unhesitating and blind
obedience to the authority of the General or his
subordinates.&nbsp; To impregnate the mind with this one
principle of obedience, appears to be the leading object of
Jesuit education.&nbsp; One of the learned Jesuits with whom the
Rev. H. Seymour conversed at Rome, stated that their &ldquo;great
and cardinal principle was, that obedience was the greatest
Christian duty, and humility the highest Christian virtue, and
that this principle was the grand element of their
power.&rdquo;&nbsp; He added, moreover, that it was &ldquo;so
deeply fixed and rooted, that it were as hard to uproot it as to
uproot the belief of a God, or of religion.&rdquo; <a
name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24"
class="citation">[24]</a>&nbsp; Accordingly, when a novice is a
candidate for admission, he has to undergo six methods of
probation, some of which can have no other purpose than
effectually to try the completeness of his surrender.&nbsp; He
must first pass through the spiritual <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>exercises to be described hereafter;
he must next spend a month in a hospital, or amongst any other
sick to whom he may be appointed.&nbsp; The third trial is, that
he should set out destitute of money, for a whole month, to beg
his bread from door to door.&nbsp; The fourth, that on his return
to the house he should there execute the most menial and abject
offices.&nbsp; The fifth, that he should employ himself for a
time in the instruction of the young or ignorant.&nbsp; And the
sixth, that, if thus approved, he should act for a time as
preacher or confessor. <a name="citation25"></a><a
href="#footnote25" class="citation">[25]</a>&nbsp; Now, it is
obvious that of these trials the third and fourth can have no
other object than to break down all respect for private will and
judgment, and to test the extent to which the unfortunate victim
will submit his soul to the will of his wily captors.&nbsp; There
is no moral or religious end to be thus accomplished; the common
footboy would clean shoes better than the accomplished historian
or philosopher; and it is quite impossible to imagine any other
motive for imposing such tasks upon the novices, (many of whom
are accomplished gentlemen, and some, I fear, once clergymen from
our own Church and universities,) than the desire utterly to
crush them at the outset of their career, to eradicate all
individuality of will and judgment, and to bring them out from
the preparatory process prepared to act out the will of their
Superior, though his requirements may be revolting to their
taste, repugnant to their judgment, and in <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>direct
violation to their conscientious conviction of right and
wrong.</p>
<p>Thus, <i>e.g.</i>, when the novice has returned from his month
of mendicancy, to discharge the menial offices of the
establishment, there is provision made in the printed documents
of the Order, that the nauseous dose shall take full effect upon
the constitution; for as it would be very natural that, when the
cook should find some man of rank and learning appointed to his
kitchen as the scullion, he should show towards him some small
measure of respectful courtesy, the rule of the Examen has
expressly directed to the contrary.&nbsp; &ldquo;It were
better,&rdquo; it says, &ldquo;that the cook should avoid a
softened style of request towards the novice; let him rather,
with modesty, command him to do this or that.&nbsp; For if he
speaks as a request, it is then a man addressing a man; thus it
will be a cook&mdash;a layman, asking a priest to wash an earthen
pot, or to do anything of this kind, which would seem neither
decent nor proper.&nbsp; Whereas if he uses the style of
command,&mdash;&lsquo;Do this,&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Do
that,&rsquo;&mdash;then it is at once understood that he speaks
as in the name and person of Christ: it is not the voice of the
cook that is heard, nor even that of the Superior, but of the
Lord.&rdquo; <a name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a></p>
<p>When a man has once submitted to such a process, there is no
difficulty in perceiving that he must come out from it an abject
slave.&nbsp; Once convinced that he is to regard the order of the
cook as <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>the voice of the Lord, he is obviously prepared to
receive the directions of the General as the expressions of the
same Divine and holy will.&nbsp; Thus Loyola, in his letter on
Obedience, addressed to the Portuguese houses, in the year 1553,
and only three years before his death, says, &ldquo;I would that
every true and genuine son of the Society should be known by this
very mark, that he looks not to the person to whom he yields
obedience, but that he sees in him the Lord Christ, for whose
sake that obedience is rendered.&rdquo;&nbsp; A moment&rsquo;s
glance at such a passage shows clearly that the obedience due to
a perfect, spotless, and unchangeable Redeemer, is transferred,
without qualification, to an imperfect, short-sighted, and
fallible Superior.&nbsp; The Superior &ldquo;sits in the temple
and shows himself as God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Accordingly, in the same
letter he adds, &ldquo;Obedience is to be rendered to the
Superior, not on account of his wisdom, goodness, or any other
such-like qualities with which he may be endowed, but solely
because he is in God&rsquo;s place, and wields the authority of
Him who says, &lsquo;They that hear you, &amp;c.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a
name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27"
class="citation">[27]</a></p>
<p>Now it is plain that the obvious deduction from such a
principle is, that if all moral qualities are placed out of the
question, and if the Superior, because he is Superior, is to be
regarded by the Jesuit as God, then clearly all must be done that
is required by that Superior, whether right or wrong, scriptural
or unscriptural, sanctioned <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>or condemned by the conscience of the
individual.&nbsp; But it is also very possible that cases may
arise in which, in matters of opinion, the subordinate may differ
from the decision of his Superior, and in matters of practice may
feel a conscientious scruple in the execution of his
designs.&nbsp; It is plain, moreover, that, if the Superior holds
the place of God, he has an absolute right to the immediate
surrender both of conviction and of conscience.&nbsp; There is a
curious passage in the latter part of the &ldquo;Spiritual
Exercises,&rdquo; which proves the extent to which the Jesuit is
required to surrender his opinion, or it should be rather stated,
to belie it.&nbsp; This book was written by Loyola, solemnly
sanctioned, in a letter apostolic, after careful examination, by
Pope Paul III., and a translation of it published in the year
1847, with notes by the present General, Father Rothaan, and a
commendatory preface by no other pen than that of &ldquo;Nicholas
Wiseman, D.D., Bishop of Melipotamus;&rdquo; so that it has every
sanction, ancient and modern, which Rome can give it.&nbsp; In it
we find eighteen &ldquo;rules to be observed, in order that we
may think with the orthodox Church,&rdquo; the thirteenth of
which is as follows, and especial attention is directed to it
because it shows, not merely the slavery to which the Jesuit is
reduced, but the recklessness as to truth, of which he is
compelled to become guilty: &ldquo;That we may be altogether of
the same mind, and in conformity with the Church herself, if she
shall have defined anything to be black, which to our eyes <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>appears to be
white, we ought in like manner to pronounce it to be
black.&rdquo; <a name="citation29"></a><a href="#footnote29"
class="citation">[29]</a>&nbsp; To think it black is clearly
impossible, but to pronounce it black is here declared a
duty.</p>
<p>Suppose the question were one of practice, and the Superior
were to require some service on the part of a subordinate Jesuit,
of which that subordinate, if he dared to think, might be clearly
convinced that it was morally and scripturally wrong.&nbsp; It is
true that, according to the strict letter of the Constitutions,
such thought is impossible, because the principle of obedience is
there extended not merely to the action, but to the judgment; so
that a true and thorough-going Jesuit is prepared to vow that his
very thoughts shall be in harmony with those of his
Superior.&nbsp; But though conscience may be seared, it is very
hard to silence it; and though the sophistry of cunning schoolmen
may perplex truth with intricate questions of subtle casuistry,
there is a clear broad line of demarcation between sin and
virtue, between right and wrong, and there is a clear knowledge
of that broad distinction so immoveably fixed amidst the ruins of
our fallen nature, that it is almost impossible to imagine even a
Jesuit in any real doubt, when in the secrets of his own chamber
he calmly reflects upon the <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>question, Is a lie right, or a murder
blameless?&nbsp; But suppose that the Superior commands him
either to lie or murder, what then?&nbsp; Conscience says,
&ldquo;It is sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; The law of God says, &ldquo;It is
sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Superior says, &ldquo;It must be
done.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which then is to be obeyed?&nbsp; Mr. Seymour
put the question to his Jesuit friend at Rome.&nbsp; The man did
not hesitate to maintain that the Superior must be obeyed, and
the conscience sacrificed, and added, that &ldquo;he should
consider that the more the matter commanded was opposed to his
private judgment, revolting to his personal feelings, or wounding
to his individual conscience, the more in proportion would be the
meritoriousness of obedience under such trying
circumstances.&rdquo; <a name="citation30"></a><a
href="#footnote30" class="citation">[30]</a>&nbsp; But this, it
may be urged, was the private opinion of an individual Jesuit,
and therefore not justly chargeable upon the great body of the
Society.&nbsp; The distinction is clearly one of great
importance, for we know in our own times how men may be members
of a Church, and yet downright traitors to its principles; and
also how with our whole soul we utterly repudiate those who can
solemnly read the Thirty-nine Articles in the desk, and then
preach the direct opposite from the pulpit.&nbsp; It would not be
fair, therefore, to attach to the Order the opinions of the
individual, unless these can be proved to be fully borne out and
sanctioned by the fixed and authoritative documents of the
Society.&nbsp; Nothing, however, can be clearer, than that the
sentiments then expressed, <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>were those not of the man, but of the
Order; for in the Constitutions <a name="citation31"></a><a
href="#footnote31" class="citation">[31]</a> it is expressly
directed that &ldquo;those who live under obedience should permit
themselves to be moved and directed under Divine Providence by
their Superiors, just as if they were a corpse, which allows
itself to be moved and handled in any way, or as the staff of an
old man, which serves him wherever, and <i>in whatever thing</i>
he who holds it in his hand pleases to use it.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
perfectly true that there are exceptive clauses adroitly
inserted, in which it is said, &ldquo;When sin is not
perceived;&rdquo; and &ldquo;where sin cannot be
defined.&rdquo;&nbsp; But these are wholly neutralized by the
context; for how can the corpse or staff perceive the quality of
an action? and how can the Jesuit judge of the course which he is
pursuing, when it is expressly provided, in the very same
sentence, that his obedience must be blind, &ldquo;renouncing
with a blind obedience every opinion and opposing judgment of our
own?&rdquo;&nbsp; Nay! more.&nbsp; If he does not obey, but
attempts for one moment to hold back and plead his own
conviction, it is in the power of the Superior to lay him in a
moment under the heavy burden of mortal sin.&nbsp; The terrors of
eternal wrath are placed in the hands of the Superior, and may be
brought down with terrific weight to crush the least symptom of
doubt or hesitation in the subordinate.&nbsp; There is a
remarkable decree in the Constitutions which has been differently
understood by different authors, and <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>of which, in order to avoid the least
possibility of contradiction, I give the translation as claimed
by the advocates of the Society.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Although the Society desires that all its
Constitutions, &amp;c., should be undeviatingly observed,
according to the Institute, it desires nevertheless, that all its
members should be secured, or at least assisted against falling
into the snare of any sin which may originate from the force of
any such Constitutions or injunctions (&lsquo;Ne in laqueum
ullius peccati, quod ex vi Constitutionum, &amp;c.,
incidant&rsquo;): therefore, it hath seemed good to us in the
Lord, with the express exception of the vow of obedience to the
Pope for the time being, and the other three fundamental vows of
poverty, chastity, and obedience, to declare that no
Constitutions, declarations, or rule of life, can bind under pain
of mortal or venial sin <a name="citation32"></a><a
href="#footnote32" class="citation">[32]</a> (posse obligationem
<a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>ad
peccatum mortale vel veniale inducere).</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Unless the Superior may command them in the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ</i>, <i>or in virtue of the vow of
obedience</i>; <i>and this he may do whenever</i>, <i>and to
whomsoever</i>, <i>he may judge it conducive either to individual
good</i>, <i>or to the universal well-being of the
Society</i>.&nbsp; And in the place of the fear of offence, let
the love and desire of all perfection succeed; that the greater
glory and praise of Christ our Creator and Lord may
follow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that the poor Jesuit may be compelled to commit what he
knows to be wrong at the bidding of his Superior.&nbsp; He may
clearly see it to be utterly opposed to every principle of
Scripture; his own conscience may turn from it with horror; his
moral sense may utterly condemn it; he may see clearly <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>that he is
flying in the face of the most High God; but on he must go,
because his Superior bids him; his own judgment and moral sense
are to be sacrificed; he is to be absolutely blind as to the
character of the action he is about to perform; one thing only he
is at liberty to see clearly, and that is, that if he venture to
hesitate, he will be guilty of mortal sin.&nbsp; The Constitution
speaks indeed of the love of all perfection succeeding to the
fear of offence; but in the very same clause it places this awful
power in the hands of the Superior, and arms him with full
authority to force on his subjects, in spite of their own
consciences, by the terrific threat of the everlasting perdition
of their souls.</p>
<p>Now it may occur to some minds to inquire how a power so
tremendous can be gained and maintained over so large a body of
talented, spirited, and well-educated men?&nbsp; How is it that
the chain does not snap into fragments when required to bear such
a pressure?&nbsp; The phenomenon, I believe, may be partly
explained by the power of those religious principles which are
perverted by the Jesuits in order to secure their end.&nbsp; They
call out the principle which ought to be subject to the will of
God, and by transferring it from God to the Superior, contrive to
perpetuate their dominion.&nbsp; But on this alone they are
clearly unable to rely, for there are two most powerful
instrumentalities employed; the one at the commencement, and the
other throughout <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>the whole of the Jesuit&rsquo;s career, viz., isolation
and information.</p>
<p>If the human mind, with its conscience, will, and judgment, is
to become a simple machine in the hands of another, it is clear
that there must be some process by which independence may be
permanently annihilated.&nbsp; This process is to separate and
isolate him from his fellow-men, to cut off all connexion and
alliance with the world without, and so to engraft him into the
Society that it and it alone should be the object of his
affection, the source of his maintenance, and the sphere for his
ambition.&nbsp; It has pleased God to bind society together by
the sacred ties of natural affection; and these ties possess so
powerful a uniting influence, that unless they be severed, they
form an insurmountable barrier to the exercise of such a power as
that claimed for the General.&nbsp; By one sudden wrench,
therefore, they are to be at once and for ever severed.&nbsp; The
novice is required to pledge himself at the time of his admission
that he will have no communication either by word of mouth or
letter with either his friends or relations, and that every
letter which he either receives or writes shall be inspected by
his Superior. <a name="citation35"></a><a href="#footnote35"
class="citation">[35]</a>&nbsp; He is required, moreover, to
&ldquo;abandon natural affection&rdquo; towards all related to
him; and to such an extent is he required to carry this
unhallowed rule, that if any speak to him of his parents he is
directed to deny the <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>existence of the tie.&nbsp; &ldquo;As
the habit of speech assists the habit of the thoughts, it is a
holy precept that they should not say that they have parents or
brothers, but that they used to have them.&rdquo; <a
name="citation36a"></a><a href="#footnote36a"
class="citation">[36a]</a>&nbsp; So fearfully does the Society
fulfil the prophecy of the apostasy, by requiring its members to
be &ldquo;disobedient to parents,&rdquo; and &ldquo;without
natural affection.&rdquo; <a name="citation36b"></a><a
href="#footnote36b" class="citation">[36b]</a></p>
<p>It is not sufficient, however, that the novice be thus cut off
from his kindred; for the Society can never have a complete hold
of him so long as he is possessed of property; it is, therefore,
one of their laws that either immediately or after a year&rsquo;s
probation, <a name="citation36c"></a><a href="#footnote36c"
class="citation">[36c]</a> the novice should abandon all his
possessions, and surrender all interest in, or title to, any
property which may at the time belong to him, or may hereafter
become his by gift, by trade, by inheritance, or by any other way
whatever.&nbsp; He may be the heir of countless thousands, but,
by admission to the Society, he abandons all, and renders himself
absolutely penniless.&nbsp; From the moment of his admission he
has nothing; his daily allowance is appointed to him by the
Superior, and may be diminished or increased at pleasure.&nbsp;
From the day that he submits himself, to his dying hour, he is
dependent on his Superior for home, for clothing, for daily
bread.&nbsp; He cannot fall back upon any remnant of his
inheritance and be free, for that inheritance is for ever
gone.&nbsp; <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>Nor is it merely gone, but it is so completely alienated
as to leave him no opening for a retreat.&nbsp; Loyola knew well
that a parent&rsquo;s love is not to be extinguished by the
temporary delusion of the child, and that in the parent&rsquo;s
home there is always a welcome for the wanderer.&nbsp; He,
therefore, with great forethought provided that the property
should be completely alienated from the family, and devoted to
the poor, &ldquo;to pious works, or to any worthy men who will
use it to the advance of the service of God,&rdquo; <a
name="citation37a"></a><a href="#footnote37a"
class="citation">[37a]</a> which of course includes the Society
of the Jesuits.&nbsp; The only persons who are excluded from a
share are the relations, &ldquo;in order,&rdquo; as the rule
declares, &ldquo;that the novices may exhibit a better example to
all classes of abandoning inordinate affection to their parents,
and of avoiding the inconveniences of an inordinate distribution
which arises from the aforesaid affection; and also that they may
persevere more firmly and steadily in their vocation, when every
avenue of return to their parents and relations, and to the
useless recollection of them, is cut off.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="citation37b"></a><a href="#footnote37b"
class="citation">[37b]</a>&nbsp; When this is done, the
dependance of the Jesuit on the General is complete.&nbsp; If he
be a man of talent he may be placed by him in a first-rate
position, where every wish is gratified; he may be supplied with
ample means and introduced to the best society; he may have,
moreover, the prospect of almost unbounded power should he raise
himself to the higher ranks of <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>the Order by his unscrupulous ability
in its service.&nbsp; But all this is on the one condition of
unqualified and unscrupulous obedience.&nbsp; Should he venture
to resist, the General may order him, without assigning any
reason, to become a menial in a convent, a scavenger in the
street, or perhaps a missionary in the most distant and deadly
station of the Society.&nbsp; But why not break the yoke and be
free? some may inquire.&nbsp; But how is he to do it?&nbsp; Let
him rebel against the General, and he goes out upon the world a
wanderer,&mdash;friendless, penniless, homeless, hopeless.&nbsp;
If he be in a Protestant country the case is different; for there
are warm hearts to welcome him, and if once his sincerity is
established, there are abundance of those who love the Lord, who
would rejoice to assist him in his struggles, and befriend him in
his efforts to be free.&nbsp; But suppose that he is in a Roman
Catholic country, his whole character is lost on his withdrawal
from his Order; and if he were to throw himself on those who were
once his relatives, it would only be to be treated by them as one
who had first robbed them of their lawful property, and now,
having changed his mind, was returning amongst them a renegade
and apostate from the faith.&nbsp; On, therefore, he is compelled
to go.&nbsp; It may be against his conscience, against his
judgment, against his deepest feelings of filial affection, or
his noblest principles of patriotism or philanthropy.&nbsp; He
may be called to betray his own brother, or to move <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>sedition
against his own Queen: but, the vow once taken, there is no room
for a retreat, and unless he is prepared to throw himself as an
outcast upon the world, he must consent to do that which he
abhors, and to use his own talents in a course of action which he
condemns.</p>
<p>But why does not faith rise above it all and triumph?&nbsp;
There must be many devoted and high-minded men in the ranks of
that vast Society; why do they not rise up in faith, and in the
name of the Lord take their choice boldly, and say once for all,
&ldquo;We had rather die than obey and sin?&rdquo;&nbsp; Some
have already done so with success, and through faith have
triumphed; how many more have struggled to do so, none will know
till the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed.&nbsp; For this
isolation at the outset is followed up by a constant system of
the closest watching afterwards.&nbsp; So strict and complete is
this espionage, that it is almost impossible for the Jesuit to
think a thought without detection.&nbsp; There cannot be a more
fearful evidence of the miserable state of iron bondage to which
conscientious Jesuits are reduced than the provision made for
their discovery.&nbsp; If they were content, why should they be
watched?&nbsp; But we find it is one of the principles of the
Order, that every Jesuit is to be a spy upon every other, and
that everything bearing upon character is to be transmitted by
every individual to the Superior.&nbsp; When a young man is
admitted, he is especially examined upon this very <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>point, and is
required not merely to give his consent that everything observed
respecting his own character should be reported, but to add his
promise that he will himself act as a spy and informer on all
around him. <a name="citation40a"></a><a href="#footnote40a"
class="citation">[40a]</a>&nbsp; Added to which, they are not,
except on especial services, allowed to be alone.&nbsp; In Roman
Catholic countries they may always be seen two and two, and it is
said that in some of the Colleges the young men are required to
go three and three, in order that if two are agreed in anything,
they may be detected and betrayed by the third.&nbsp; Now these
companions be it remembered, are not self-chosen, they are not
drawn together by any sympathy or affinity of heart, but every
appointment is made by the General; so that if any young man of a
tender conscience and hopeful spirit should venture to begin to
inquire respecting the great principles of the faith, there is
nothing easier than to place with him some artful and
well-skilled servant of the Company, who shall gain his
confidence by apparent sympathy, and then betray every
disclosure. <a name="citation40b"></a><a href="#footnote40b"
class="citation">[40b]</a>&nbsp; If, moreover, he ever receives
or sends a letter without express permission, his doing so is
regarded as a mortal sin; nor can the guilt be absolved by the
usual confessor, but the offence must be transmitted as a
reserved case <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>to the Superior. <a name="citation41"></a><a
href="#footnote41" class="citation">[41]</a>&nbsp; Imagine what
it would be to work your way out of such a thraldom, when every
word you uttered, every book you read, every friend you spoke to,
was observed and reported to those who had absolute dominion over
your movements.&nbsp; But more than this.&nbsp; There are secrets
in the deep recesses of the soul which even the practised spy
cannot penetrate, and there are searchings of heart, which,
unless willingly discovered, are known only to the individual and
to God.&nbsp; But the poor Jesuit is not to have even a thought
which he may call his own.&nbsp; It is the privilege of other
Roman Catholics to choose their own confessor, and they may go to
the priest in whom they place the greatest confidence; but it is
not so with the Jesuit.&nbsp; Like everything else, his confessor
is appointed for him, and, of course, just such an one as is best
calculated to lay open the secrets of his heart.&nbsp; But even
this is not enough.&nbsp; When the novice is admitted, he is led
to believe that his confessions are sacred, and not liable to be
reported, a point on which the Roman Catholic mind is naturally
particularly sensitive.&nbsp; But besides the confession, the
Jesuit is required periodically to go through a process termed
the manifestation of his conscience, in which every wish,
thought, fear, habit, pleasure, object of interest, is to be laid
open to his Superior.&nbsp; The object of this manifestation is
stated in the Examen to be, that the Superior may be acquainted
with the internal as well as the external <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>character,
that he may at all times select the most suitable agents for his
missions or other services, and that so he may best provide for
the good of the whole body of the Society. <a
name="citation42a"></a><a href="#footnote42a"
class="citation">[42a]</a>&nbsp; It is perfectly clear,
therefore, that the results of these manifestations, although
they are said to be <i>sub sigillo</i>, are all transmitted to
the General, and obtained for that very purpose.&nbsp; Now
transfer your thoughts to that confessional, and suppose there a
conscientious, an inquiring Jesuit.&nbsp; It is the creed of his
Church, which he believes infallible, that, if anything is kept
back in confession, the absolution is null and void, and that,
without the absolution, he remains under the wrath of God.&nbsp;
With this conviction he kneels down before the wily Father, who
is ready with dexterous skill to draw out from him under the
pressure of his religious conviction every doubt that has ever
troubled him, every book that he has ever read, and every opinion
that he has ever entertained upon the subject.&nbsp; If any
wavering is discovered in confession, it is all written down and
carefully transmitted as a reserved case to the General. <a
name="citation42b"></a><a href="#footnote42b"
class="citation">[42b]</a>&nbsp; But should it be brought to
light in the manifestation of his conscience, it must all, as a
matter of course, be forwarded to Rome.&nbsp; The result of which
is that <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>in
a few weeks the young man is seen no more; perhaps he is gone to
some distant land; perhaps he is sent off to be a servant in some
distant convent; perhaps he finds himself in the vaults of the
Inquisition; perhaps he dies.&nbsp; And all that can be said is
that the young man is gone,&mdash;those who once knew him know
him no more,&mdash;his place is filled by another&mdash;he is
gone.</p>
<p>How then is a young man to break away from Jesuitism? and how
deeply ought we to compassionate the poor unhappy victim of such
a monstrous and soul-enthralling tyranny?&nbsp; Oh! there is
something inexpressibly melancholy in the thought that there are
thousands of intelligent men at this very hour, thus enslaved,
and that the original means of their slavery was their real
desire for life eternal in Christ Jesus.&nbsp; There are, I
believe, untold horrors within the walls of the Inquisition, but
better far would it be to have the poor body lacerated there by a
merciless Inquisitor, while the conscience was free, and the
conviction of the heart obeyed, than to be forced on through life
a slave, and yet apparently a free man; responsible to God for
transgression, and yet compelled to sin, because there is no
power to burst the fetters which men have rivetted on the
soul.</p>
<p>And what makes the case more melancholy still is that the vows
are frequently taken in very early youth.&nbsp; Mr. Seymour
states that although some join in later life, the great majority
are trained in the seminaries <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>of the Society, and that many take
the vows at the early age of eighteen.&nbsp; When such is the
case it is clear that the unhappy novice is completely secured
before he has any opportunity of forming an acquaintance with the
world.&nbsp; He renounces domestic happiness before he knows its
joys, and gives up his property before he learns its value.&nbsp;
In the simplicity of his boyhood he gradually imbibes the
principles of his instructor, and is trained to regard obedience
as the essence of Christianity; and then, just at the moment when
the powers begin to be developed, and the mind to put forth its
strength in independent action, the yoke is rivetted, and the
poor captive made a slave for life.&nbsp; Nor is he in this
important step allowed even his father&rsquo;s counsel.&nbsp; God
teaches the young man to look up to his parents, and say,
&ldquo;My Father, thou art the guide of my youth;&rdquo; but the
Jesuit teaches him to cast aside such guidance, and the following
iniquitous rule is laid down in the secret instructions of the
Society: &ldquo;Let them be strictly cautioned not to make the
least discovery of their call to any intimate friend, not even
their parents, before they are admitted.&rdquo; <a
name="citation44"></a><a href="#footnote44"
class="citation">[44]</a></p>
<p>Now if a young man is thus to give up all in behalf of the
Society&mdash;if property is to be sacrificed, and parents
abandoned&mdash;the very least that should be done by honest men
is to set the whole system fully and frankly before him.&nbsp; He
should at all <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>events have the opportunity of considering well the
consequences of his decision.&nbsp; But as he is cut off from
seeking the counsel of his father, so is he forbidden even to
make himself acquainted with the whole of the Constitutions of
the Society; and I find a passage in the outset of the Examen,
which expressly directs, &ldquo;That all the Constitutions be not
read by those who come as novices, but only a compendium of those
parts from which they may learn what they have themselves to
do.&rdquo; <a name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"
class="citation">[45]</a>&nbsp; He is, therefore, to be gradually
drawn on, step by step; he is never allowed to see the whole
system, lest he should recoil from it; but he is led on, little
by little, till he becomes so inextricably entangled, that there
is not the slightest possibility of a return.</p>
<p>Truly the heart burns at the thought of such an outrage on
every law of nature, on every principle of Christianity.&nbsp;
Can that be Christianity which can resort to such expedients, and
can depend for its power on such an instrumentality?&nbsp; Men
may admire Jesuitism as a beautiful and well-adjusted machinery;
they may be acquainted with individual Jesuits, and entertain a
great respect for their talents, their acquirements, their mild
and gentle manners; but let them look at the great broad facts of
the system, at the cruel and oppressive apparatus, which is
brought to bear on the conscience of its members, at the absolute
crushing of all individual principle and conviction, at the early
age at which sanguine <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>youths are entangled and enslaved;
and then let them decide whether it is possible that such a
system can have the most distant connexion with that glorious
liberty wherewith Christ has made us free.&nbsp; Does not the
Gospel fill men with joy and peace in believing?&nbsp; Does it
not elevate the soul to sweet and holy communion with God?&nbsp;
Does it not purify the heart and make the conscience sensitive to
sin?&nbsp; And can that be consistent, I appeal to any Roman
Catholic, with such a system as that of Jesuitry, which seizes a
young man at the age of eighteen, strips him of his property,
isolates him from his home, deadens his conscience, closes
against him every possibility of escape, and then sends him forth
into society, the thinking tool, the acting instrument in the
hands of his captor?</p>

<span class="GutSmall">MORALITY.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is stated by Mr. Seymour that
the character of the Society is in high esteem for morality at
Rome.&nbsp; One of them said to him, &ldquo;We have been charged
with being crafty intriguers&mdash;with intermeddling in
politics&mdash;with swaying princes&mdash;with disturbing
kingdoms&mdash;with embroiling families.&nbsp; We have been
charged with everything but one.&nbsp; No man has ever charged us
with personal immorality.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mr. Seymour adds, that
this boast is certainly true as respects the Jesuits of Rome; so
true that whereas all men in that city hesitate not to denounce
the other Monkish orders as idle, debauched, licentious, they
never breathe a whisper against the personal morality of the
Jesuits.&nbsp; If morality were confined to the absence of
profligacy, I believe that the same might be said of the personal
behaviour of the great majority of modern Jesuits; but if we take
the term in its wider and nobler sense, as expressing the moral
will of God, or the reflection of it in the moral sense, which
still remains within the heart, notwithstanding our ruin in the
fall: if morality convey to us the idea of <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>purity,
truth, honesty, justice, and all those noble principles which
should regulate man&rsquo;s intercourse with man, then I believe
it may be shown to demonstration that the Order has sanctioned
principles which are sufficient to dissolve every moral tie, and,
if extensively prevalent, to break up the whole fabric of
society.&nbsp; I do not mean that such principles are boldly
stated in their Constitutions and public documents, for, of
course, it would not answer their purpose to avow them.&nbsp; But
they are maintained and defended by their most celebrated
writers, and if we only bear in mind that no Jesuit is permitted
to publish any book without first submitting it to his Superior,
it is clear that the Society becomes responsible for every
publication of its members.&nbsp; The leading principles of the
Order strips the writer of his individuality, and every
publication of every individual amongst them becomes an
authorized document of the Society.&nbsp; It cannot go forth
without the imprimatur of the General, and if it has that
imprimatur, then the Society becomes responsible for its
sentiments. <a name="citation48"></a><a href="#footnote48"
class="citation">[48]</a></p>
<p>Let us take one or two specimens of their moral maxims.</p>
<p><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>The
reader has doubtless heard of the doctrine of Probability; the
principle of which is, that if any writer of repute has
recommended a certain conduct, then that conduct becomes probably
right.&nbsp; If any author, especially any modern, has advanced a
certain opinion, then that opinion becomes probable.&nbsp; It
matters not what evidence there is against it.&nbsp; It may be
condemned by the concurrent voice of all honest men, but still it
is rendered probable if defended by a single individual.</p>
<p>But what results from this probability? and what harm is done
if the opinion be accounted probable?&nbsp; It is really almost
inconceivable that any men should have had the daring to advance
such a maxim as may be found in countless passages in the
writings of the Order.&nbsp; It is nothing less than this.&nbsp;
That if any opinion be probable it may be adopted with a clear
conscience, and if any action be probably right, a man may
perform it and be harmless, whatever be its character.&nbsp; Mr.
Dalton quotes the following passage, amongst many others, from
George De Rhodes:<a name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49"
class="citation">[49]</a>&mdash;&ldquo;The authority of one good
doctor is a sufficient reason on which to ground the probability
of any opinion; <i>so that every one may safely follow
it</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Where, Oh, where is the vaunted certainty of
Romish teaching?&nbsp; We hear of men seeking rest in
Rome&rsquo;s authority in order that their soul may be satisfied
with certainty.&nbsp; And the <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>human mind requires certainty; the
interests of eternity are far too solemn to allow men to rest
satisfied if their only hope be in a doubt or an opinion.&nbsp;
But who, we may boldly challenge them to answer us, has the
certainty now,&mdash;the poor unhappy man who is floating hither
and thither on a whole sea of Jesuitical probabilities?&mdash;or
the man who can plant his firm foot on the immoveable rock of the
unchanging word of the living God, and fearlessly declare,
&ldquo;This is certain, because it is inspired; this is truth,
because God has revealed it in the Bible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems at first sight that such principles as these must
lead to endless perplexity and embarrassment, and so they must if
all love of truth be not first extinguished.&nbsp; But on the
other hand it is clear that they give unbounded latitude in
conduct, and by referring truth to the ever-varying standard of
man&rsquo;s opinion, enable the Jesuit to justify anything.&nbsp;
Pascal puts this with great power in his &ldquo;Provincial
Letters.&rdquo;&nbsp; He supposes a Jesuit father to be
conversing with him as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;They, the authors,
are very often of different opinions; but that does not signify;
every one renders his own probable and sure.&nbsp; We well know
that they have not the same sentiments, it is all the better for
that.&nbsp; On the contrary, they hardly ever agree.&nbsp; There
are very few questions where you will not find that one says yes,
and the other no.&nbsp; In all cases of that sort, one and the
other of the contrary opinions is <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>probable.&nbsp; But, my father, said
I, we must be very much embarrassed in choosing!&nbsp; Not at
all, said he, you have only to follow the one that pleases the
most.&nbsp; What! if the other is more probable?&nbsp; It does
not signify, said he.&nbsp; And if the other is more
certain?&nbsp; It does not signify, repeated the father; here it
is, well explained.&nbsp; It is Emmanuel Sa, of our Society, in
his aphorism De Dubiis:&mdash;&lsquo;We may do what we think
lawful according to a probable opinion, although the contrary may
be more certain.&nbsp; The opinion of a grave doctor is
sufficient.&rsquo; . . .&nbsp; We have certainly large scope,
reverend father, said I, thanks to your probable opinions.&nbsp;
We have fine liberty of conscience.&nbsp; And you casuists, have
you the same liberty in your answers?&nbsp; Yes, said he, we
answer as we please, or rather as pleases those who consult us,
for here are our rules taken from our fathers, Layman, Vasquez,
Sanchez, &amp;c.&nbsp; Here are the words of
Layman:&mdash;&lsquo;A doctor upon being consulted can give
advice not only probable, according to his opinion, but contrary
to his opinion, if it is estimated probable by others when his
contrary advice is found more favourable and more agreeable to
the person that consults him.&nbsp; But I say more, it would not
be at all wrong that he should give to those who consult him, an
opinion held probable by some learned person, even while he
himself knew it to be absolutely false.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Are we then to place our souls under the guidance of such
teachers?&nbsp; Are we to abandon the pure, <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>the clear,
the unerring truth of Scripture, at the bidding of one who is
ready to declare black white, and white black, at the bidding of
his Church?&nbsp; I solemnly appeal to any Roman Catholic into
whose hands this Lecture may ever fall, Can this be
Christianity?&nbsp; Can such a system be from God?&nbsp; Is this
the Divine and eternal truth which you are seeking in the Church
of Rome?&nbsp; Nay, more!&nbsp; Can you place the smallest
confidence in any Jesuit, priest or confessor, when you find it
boldly asserted that he may give you an opinion as to the great
concerns of your soul&rsquo;s salvation, which at the very time
he gives it he knows in his own heart to be absolutely false?</p>
<p>But their principles of equivocation, mental restriction, and
the direction of intention, are equally subversive of all that is
trustworthy amongst men.</p>
<p>By equivocation they mean the use of terms of so ambiguous a
character that the hearer receives them in one sense, while the
speaker employs them in another.</p>
<p>By mental restriction is intended the suppression of certain
parts of a sentence, so as to give to the remainder a meaning
opposed to truth.&nbsp; Pascal quotes the following passage from
one Sanchez: &ldquo;A man may swear,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that
he has not done a thing, although in fact he has done it, meaning
within himself that he did not do it <i>on a certain day</i>, or
<i>before he was born</i>, or understanding some <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>other similar
circumstance, without permitting it to appear in any way through
the words employed! and this,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;is very
convenient on many occasions, and is always perfectly right when
it is necessary for the health, the honour, or the
interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the direction of intention is meant the proposing to
oneself an object of intention entirely at variance with the act
committed: as, <i>e.g.</i>, the Jesuits in South India encouraged
their converts to bow down before heathen idols, on the principle
that though the act of adoration was given to the idol, the
intention was directed to a small crucifix which each of the
worshippers had concealed about his person.&nbsp; Thus, argues
Pascal, with his keen satire, &ldquo;They content the world by
permitting the sinful action, and they satisfy the Gospel by
purifying the intention.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You give to
men,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;the outward and material effects of
the action, and you render to God the interior and spiritual
movement of the intention: so that by this equitable division you
produce an alliance between the human law and the
Divine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now there is nothing in the whole catalogue
of crime which may not be justified by such a monstrous
principle.&nbsp; Pascal quotes passages to show that a man may
even commit murder, provided only that his intention be to
preserve his honour, and not to take revenge upon his enemy; nor
is there any one of the blackest crimes that have ever disgraced
humanity, which may not be justified, <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>if we are to admit the idea that the
act can be separate from the will; that the heart can be pure,
while the hand is defiled in blood, or the intention acceptable
to God, while the outward action is in direct opposition to his
law.</p>
<p>Such are specimens of the principles of moral conduct advanced
by the writers of the Society.&nbsp; It is clear at a
moment&rsquo;s glance that they are destructive of every moral
obligation, and give unbounded license to every kind of
crime.&nbsp; Now, it is a question of very great interest, how
far is the Church of Rome as a body identified with those
principles of the Jesuits?&nbsp; I do not say how far are
Romanists as individuals, because I am fully aware that a
conscientious Romanist would recoil from them with as much
aversion as ourselves.&nbsp; It is not a nice point of
controversial theology, but a simple matter of right and wrong;
and whatever men may think on such a subject as
transubstantiation, no honourable man can approve of mental
restriction.&nbsp; I take it for granted therefore, that the
great body of Roman Catholic Englishmen condemn them.&nbsp; But
how does the Church <i>as a Church</i> stand affected by
them?&nbsp; It has been already shewn that as the Society claims
an absolute control over all Jesuit authors, it becomes thereby
responsible for their sentiments.&nbsp; But still this does not
reach the Popedom; the Company may be guilty, and not
Popery.&nbsp; But not so when we find that on August 4, 1814,
Pope Pius VII. issued a Bull in which, by Pontifical authority,
he <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>solemnly sanctioned the re-establishment of the
Order.&nbsp; It is true that this Bull was in flat contradiction
to that of Clement XIV., so that one infallible Pope was in
direct opposition to another. <a name="citation55"></a><a
href="#footnote55" class="citation">[55]</a>&nbsp; But that is
not our concern&mdash;it is not our business to decide which of
the two infallibles was wrong,&mdash;all that we may leave to
those who believe in their infallibility.&nbsp; The one important
fact for us is this, that Pope Pius VII. re-established the Order
in 1814, and that his Bull remains to this day unretracted in the
archives of the Vatican.&nbsp; It is also important to observe
that he did it with these moral enormities fully in view.&nbsp;
Of course, as an infallible person, he must have known Jesuit
doctrine through the simple power of his own infallibility; but
even if that had failed him, he had in the archives of the
Vatican the language of Clement stating
distinctly:&mdash;&ldquo;And further, concerning the use and
exposition of certain maxims, which the Holy See has with reason
proscribed, as scandalous and manifestly contrary <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>to good
morals.&rdquo;&nbsp; So that our heavy charge against the Popedom
is, that with all these facts clearly in view, the Pope put his
seal and sanction upon the Company.&nbsp; He ordained that these
letters of his should be &ldquo;inviolably observed in all time
coming,&rdquo; and accordingly to this hour they are in
force.&nbsp; He declares that he should &ldquo;consider it a
great crime against God if, amidst these dangers of the Christian
republic, he neglected the aids which the especial providence of
God had placed at his disposal;&rdquo; a crime, that is, to
neglect the aid of an Order which breaks down truth by the
doctrine of probabilities, and gives a loose rein to every sinful
action by the licentious theory, that in the midst of crime the
intention may be pure.&nbsp; Are these, then, the weapons, and
are these the principles, on which the Church of Rome relies for
the maintenance of power? and if they be,&mdash;I ask the
question fearlessly, Can it be the Church of God?&nbsp; Do not
now perplex your minds by a few hard texts, or the nice
subtilties of acute controversialists.&nbsp; But look at the
great, broad, and admitted features of Jesuitical morality; and
then look at the Papacy leaning for support on that very Order,
though all its principles are open and exposed before the world,
and decide, can that Papacy be the Spouse of Christ?&mdash;can
that be the truth of God, which leans on such a system for its
support?&mdash;can he be the Vicar of our blessed Lord who gives
his unqualified sanction to a Society acting on such principles?
to a body of men the very <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>essence of whose system is that they
are ready to declare black white, and white black, at a bidding
of the Pope? <a name="citation57"></a><a href="#footnote57"

<h2><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">RELIGION.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> seems strange to mention the
holy name of religion in connexion with such principles as those
of probability and intention, and the first feeling of the heart
is to rise up in holy indignation, and to declare it is utterly
impossible that religion can have anything to do with such a
system.&nbsp; But such a conclusion would be clearly incorrect;
for not only do the facts prove that there is a certain religious
principle in action, but I believe it may be shewn that such
results could not be produced except through the power of a
debased and perverted Christianity.&nbsp; The assertion may
startle some, but I believe that upon investigation it will be
found true, that there is less power in bare, barren, blank
Infidelity, to break down the morality of a man, than there is in
a Gospel, debased and defiled to suit his purposes.&nbsp;
Infidelity gives no sop to the conscience, no chloroform to
destroy the sense of sin, nor can it altogether root out the
moral sense, however mournfully it may sear and deaden it.&nbsp;
But the case is different with a debased religion.&nbsp; It
overpowers conscience, by setting off against it the spurious <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>principles of
a pretended Christianity.&nbsp; It produces certain maxims, for
which it claims pre-eminence, because it says they come from
Christ; and, by the very authority which they derive from the
misappropriation of that holy name, it tramples the moral sense
under foot, and leaves the pervert ready for any enormity that it
may require.&nbsp; I have no doubt, therefore, in my own mind,
that a large proportion of the Company of Jesuits are, in one
sense, religious men; nor can we look at the history of Jesuit
missions, at their indefatigable zeal, untiring self-denial,
patient endurance, and, in some instances, cheerful martyrdom,
without the conviction that a deep religious feeling has been
more or less their actuating power.&nbsp; But more than
this,&mdash;you may see it even in their crimes; you may there
obtain the most perfect illustration of the statement just made,
that a perverted religion may be called in to give its sanction
to those crimes which an Infidel without religion dare not
commit.&nbsp; Look, for example, at the letter of Sir Everard
Digby to his wife, written when he was under sentence of death
for the Gunpowder Plot, in which he says,&mdash;&ldquo;Now for my
intention, let me tell you, that if I had thought there had been
the least sin in the plot, I would not have been of it for all
the world, and no other cause led me to hazard my fortune and
life but zeal for God&rsquo;s religion.&rdquo; <a
name="citation59"></a><a href="#footnote59"
class="citation">[59]</a>&nbsp; Look again at the remarkable
fact, that those conspirators received a solemn mass <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>from a Jesuit
father of the name of Gerard, when they solemnly swore to do
their part in the conspiracy; and that the whole scheme was known
to Garnett, the Provincial of the Society. <a
name="citation60"></a><a href="#footnote60"
class="citation">[60]</a>&nbsp; So that the solemn sanction of
the Lord&rsquo;s death and sufferings was thrown over all the
enormous guilt of that long-premeditated and wholesale
murder.</p>
<p>But then the question arises, What can be the perversion of
Christianity which can lead to such an abandonment of the moral
sense?&nbsp; The full answer to the question might occupy
volumes; but there is one root to which, I believe, the whole may
be traced; and although it may seem at first scarcely sufficient
to produce so vast a Upas-tree, yet I believe it will be found in
fact that the whole plant has sprung from it;&mdash;I mean, the
substitution of man for God in the great business of the
soul&rsquo;s guidance and salvation.</p>
<p>The passages already quoted prove this substitution very
clearly, with reference to the guidance of the Jesuit; but if
there were any doubt of it, it would be removed by the oath of
profession, in which it is sworn,&mdash;&ldquo;I, N., make
profession, and promise Almighty God, before his Virgin Mother,
and before the heavenly hosts, and before all bystanders, and
you, Rev. Father, General of the Society of Jesus, <i>holding the
place of God</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is, therefore, a double
transfer of Divine authority.&nbsp; The Pope stands between the
General and God, and the <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>General between the Jesuit and the
Pope.&nbsp; There is a double delegation of Divine powers, the
Lord being said to confer them on the Pope, the Pope conferring
them on the General, and the Jesuit then swearing, in the most
solemn moment of his life, that the General &ldquo;holds the
place of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; And what must be the necessary
result?&nbsp; That moral truth is no longer learned from the
fountain of truth, but from the corrupt, the designing, the human
authority that stands between the Creator and the soul.&nbsp; The
Divine law is obscured, the human will is adopted in its
place.&nbsp; The result of such a change must obviously be, that
the character of the body must become the mere reflection of the
character of the head; that his corruptions take the place of
Divine perfections; and his schemes, whatever be their nature,
are regarded as identical with the glory of the Lord.&nbsp; Hence
the very religion of the Jesuit prepares him for any desperate
measures provided only that his Superior gives his sanction to
them; and the more that his soul feels in earnest, the more ready
will he be to plunge on in any course of action, if only his
head, a man quite as fallible as himself, and perhaps more
corrupt, gives the word of command, and sanctions the foul act by
his authority.</p>
<p>There is obedience, but, being transferred to a wrong object,
the right principle produces a depraved and corrupt result.&nbsp;
There is zeal, but it is all put out for the furtherance of the
plans of a scheming man, instead of rising high to the blessed
end of <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>seeking God&rsquo;s glory.&nbsp; There is some fear
towards God, but it is directed not by God himself, but the
Superior; and hence it follows that the Jesuits, whilst they set
aside the practical use of Scripture, do in fact confirm its
truth; for they stand out as living witnesses to the unfailing
truth of that remarkable passage which connects alienation of
heart with the substitution of human for Divine instruction, and
says,&mdash;&ldquo;This people draw near me with their mouth, and
with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far
from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of
men.&rdquo; <a name="citation62"></a><a href="#footnote62"
class="citation">[62]</a></p>
<p>There is just the same substitution of man for God in the
great work of a sinner&rsquo;s salvation; and from this, as the
root, may be said to spring the whole remainder of the
system.&nbsp; Loyola, as is well known, struggled hard for
peace.&nbsp; Deeply convinced of sin, he passed through an agony
of soul in search of life; and, failing to find it as God has
revealed it, in free grace and full redemption, he made a
desperate plunge into Jesuitry, and the creation of the Order was
the result.&nbsp; His book of &ldquo;Spiritual Exercises,&rdquo;
written shortly after the time of his conflict, is still the
standing work for the Jesuit&rsquo;s personal religion.&nbsp; The
reader has been already informed of the high authority by which
it has been introduced to the British public, but few who are not
acquainted with the mechanical character of the whole Romish
system will be prepared for the mournful substitution <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>of
man&rsquo;s action for God&rsquo;s grace, which pervades both the
preface and the book.&nbsp; The book contains a plan for passing
a novice through a kind of spiritual manufacture in twenty-eight
days; or rather, it used to be twenty-eight days in the time of
Loyola; but we travel now by railroads, and everything moves
quickly, so that Cardinal Wiseman states in his preface that the
twenty-eight days may now be reduced to ten. <a
name="citation63a"></a><a href="#footnote63a"
class="citation">[63a]</a>&nbsp; Now, learn what may be
accomplished in these ten days.&nbsp; The Cardinal
says,&mdash;&ldquo;It is not a treatise on sin, or virtue; it is
not a method of Christian perfection; but it contains the entire
practice of perfection, by making us at once conquer sin, and
acquire virtue.&rdquo; <a name="citation63b"></a><a
href="#footnote63b" class="citation">[63b]</a>&nbsp; Now, it is a
question of the deepest interest to ascertain the process by
which sin is to be conquered in twenty-eight, or by us moderns in
ten days.&nbsp; It is a secret that many a sin-burdened
conscience would give worlds, if it had them, to discover.&nbsp;
But really it is most deeply affecting to turn to the book, and
see the utter emptiness of the whole scheme.&nbsp; According to
the Cardinal, &ldquo;it is divided into four weeks, and each of
these has its specific object, to advance the exercitant an
additional step towards perfect virtue.&nbsp; If the work of each
week be thoroughly done, this is actually accomplished.&rdquo; <a
name="citation63c"></a><a href="#footnote63c"
class="citation">[63c]</a></p>
<p>The aim of the first week, according to the same authority,
&ldquo;is the cleansing of the conscience from <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>past sin, and
of the affections from their future dangers.&rdquo;&nbsp; And how
is this mighty result to be accomplished? how is the conscience
to be cleansed from the past, and the affections guaranteed for
the future?&nbsp; How is the frail and wavering heart of man to
be so purified in a single week, that it shall go out into a
world of trial and temptation, &ldquo;cleansed against future
danger?&rdquo;&nbsp; Really it makes the heart sad to read the
miserable and mournful absence of all that the Gospel has
provided for a sinner.&nbsp; Loyola knew what sin was, and had
bitterly felt its sting, so that there are touching signs of the
sincerity of the deep inward conflict which passed within his
soul.&nbsp; But the melancholy part of the whole matter is, that
there is no hint at the only remedy.&nbsp; There is not a single
passage in which the troubled conscience is directed to the
atonement, as God&rsquo;s provision for man&rsquo;s free pardon;
not a single allusion to the Lord&rsquo;s advocacy, and no
mention of either the name or the office of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp;
But in the place of all this, there are certain rules to be
observed during the retreat.&nbsp; If the inquirer is in
business, he must be satisfied with the devotion of an hour and a
half daily to the work. <a name="citation64a"></a><a
href="#footnote64a" class="citation">[64a]</a>&nbsp; If he has
more leisure, he is directed &ldquo;to migrate from his former
habitation into some more secret house or cell;&rdquo; <a
name="citation64b"></a><a href="#footnote64b"
class="citation">[64b]</a> being there, he is &ldquo;to deprive
himself of all the brightness of the light, shutting the doors
and windows as long as he remains there, except while <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>he has to
read or take his food.&rdquo; <a name="citation65a"></a><a
href="#footnote65a" class="citation">[65a]</a>&nbsp; He is
&ldquo;to direct his eyes on no one, unless the occasion of
saluting or taking leave require it;&rdquo; <a
name="citation65b"></a><a href="#footnote65b"
class="citation">[65b]</a> &ldquo;he is to do penance by fasting,
by limiting the hours of his sleep, and by the use of hair-cloth,
ropes, iron bars, and whips;&rdquo; but, &ldquo;in preference,
whips of small cords, which hurt the outward parts, and not those
within, so as to injure the health.&rdquo; <a
name="citation65c"></a><a href="#footnote65c"
class="citation">[65c]</a>&nbsp; He is provided with a manual to
assist him in meditation, and self-examination; and, above all,
he places himself under the guidance and authority of a director,
&ldquo;for,&rdquo; says Dr. Wiseman, &ldquo;the life of a good
retreat is a good director.&rdquo; <a name="citation65d"></a><a
href="#footnote65d" class="citation">[65d]</a></p>
<p>With this apparatus complete, he sets to work, and is directed
to draw a diagram, like the following, containing seven pairs of
lines, one pair for each day. <a name="citation65e"></a><a
href="#footnote65e" class="citation">[65e]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>These
are to be employed for the measurement of his sins.&nbsp; He is
to remember and enumerate the number of times he has been in
fault, and twice every day mark the same number of points on the
proper line of the series.&nbsp; Now what is the result of the
first week&rsquo;s discipline?&nbsp; The lines, the reader will
observe, become shorter and shorter daily, till at length, at the
end of one single week, according to Dr. Wiseman, &ldquo;sin
<i>is</i> <a name="citation66a"></a><a href="#footnote66a"
class="citation">[66a]</a> abandoned, hated, loathed.&nbsp; At
the conclusion of the painful task, the soul finds itself
prostrate and full of anxieties.&nbsp; The past is remedied; but
what is to be done for the future?&rdquo; <a
name="citation66b"></a><a href="#footnote66b"
class="citation">[66b]</a></p>
<p>Such is the description given by this high authority of this
miserable, mechanical counterfeit of Christianity.&nbsp; What
becomes of the deep-seated corruption of the human heart?&nbsp;
Where is the work of the Spirit?&nbsp; And if the conscience
could be cleansed, and the past remedied by such a paltry human
artifice, where, Oh, where was the necessity for atonement? and
what need was there that Emanuel should shed his precious blood
upon the cross?</p>
<p>But does it not verify the charge which I brought against the
system, of substituting man for God in the salvation of the
sinner?&nbsp; What is it that conquers sin in the first two days
and a half of the retreat?&nbsp; Is it the Saviour?&nbsp; Is it
the Spirit?&nbsp; Or is it the man?&nbsp; Wiseman
says,&mdash;&ldquo;It is the work of each week, thoroughly
done.&rdquo; <a name="citation66c"></a><a href="#footnote66c"
class="citation">[66c]</a></p>
<p><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>To this
one leading principle all Jesuitry may without any difficulty be
traced; and if so, we may surely learn the one weapon by which it
may be resisted and overcome.&nbsp; The evil originates in the
substitution of man for God, and therefore the weapon by which it
must be opposed is the exaltation of the Lord himself, as the
only author of the soul&rsquo;s salvation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be thou
exalted, O God, in thine own strength, so will we sing and praise
thy power.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a great conflict raging.&nbsp;
There are swarms of these subtle adversaries filling the land;
there is a vast power arrayed against us; the enemy is active,
well combined, and unscrupulous; but they must not be met by
their own weapons; for we had rather have all that is dear to us
trodden under foot in the lowest dust, than gain the most
brilliant triumphs through the use of a single weapon adopted
from their armoury.&nbsp; We give them the exclusive use of all
their probabilities, and are ready to meet them, without either
subtlety or disguise, but with the plain, honest, frank, and open
bearing of honest-minded servants of the Lord; we must be
satisfied to struggle in the Lord&rsquo;s strength, and to employ
the Lord&rsquo;s weapons.&nbsp; Nor need we be afraid in the
conflict.&nbsp; Their human machinery, I freely grant, is
superior to ours; their agency more complete, and their
combination more perfect.&nbsp; &ldquo;But the Egyptians are men,
and not God, and their horses flesh, and not spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They in all their system have been guilty of the substitution of
man for God; but our <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>joy is to exalt God on his own
throne; and our certain expectation is to triumph through the
might of his own right hand.&nbsp; It is true, indeed, that they
can summon to their assistance the countless contrivances of
human subtlety, but our weapon is far superior to all, for it is
from the Lord himself, it is the sword of the Spirit, which is
the Word of God.&nbsp; There is no denying that they can assume
any guise, and worm their way into the unsuspecting family; but
our hope is in the power of the Spirit, to whom the heart itself
is open as the day.&nbsp; They can meet us, indeed, and perhaps
over-match us, in their varied appliances for intellectual
education, they may be powerful in the pulpit, and attractive in
the confessional, but they have no message that has one
thousandth part of the loveliness of ours, for, unless they are
false to their own principles, they can never proclaim to anxious
sinners a finished atonement, and free pardon through the blood
of the Lamb.&nbsp; There is much, indeed, to be apprehended in
their close combination under the able conduct of a
well-appointed General; but no general upon earth is to be
compared to the Captain of the Lord&rsquo;s hosts, whom God
himself has set apart from the beginning to be &ldquo;the leader
and commander of the people.&rdquo;&nbsp; Only let us be faithful
to that blessed Master, honouring his word, leaning on his
Spirit, at all times setting forth his grace; and the time will
come, as certainly as God&rsquo;s word is true, when the whole
fabric of Jesuitry shall be split <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>into shivers; when the prophecy shall
be fulfilled, &ldquo;Associate yourselves, and ye shall be broken
in pieces when the triumphant cry shall originate in heaven, and
shall swell back in a vast echo from a regenerate world,
&lsquo;We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, because thou
hast taken unto thee thy great power, and hast
reigned.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

extract from a letter from an English Jesuit to the Rector of the
College at Brussels:&mdash;&ldquo;I cannot choose but laugh to
see how some of our own coat have accoutred themselves; and it is
admirable how in speech and gesture they act the Puritans.&nbsp;
The Cambridge scholars, to their woful experience, shall see we
can act the Puritans a little better than they have done the
Jesuits.&nbsp; They have abused our sacred patron in jest, but we
will make them smart for it in earnest.&rdquo;&mdash;Neal&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Puritans,&rdquo; vol. i., p. 515.</p>
<p><a name="footnote20"></a><a href="#citation20"
class="footnote">[20]</a>&nbsp; The following circumstance was
recently mentioned to the author by the Rev. Hugh
Stowell:&mdash;A gentleman named Bridge settled at Salford with
three daughters.&nbsp; He appeared to be an intelligent and
active man, and being a decided Conservative, was, after a time,
made Secretary to the Manchester Conservative Association.&nbsp;
From that time there was reason to believe that the plans of the
Association were betrayed, when one morning another gentleman
named Bridge, also residing in Salford Crescent, whose Christian
name commenced with the same initial as that of the other,
received a letter from the College of Jesuits at Rome, giving him
full directions as to the manner in which he should conduct the
business of the Association.&nbsp; The Mr. Bridge who received it
forwarded it to his neighbour, and the Conservative Secretary
disappeared from Salford Crescent that afternoon.</p>

class="footnote">[29]</a>&nbsp; In the translation the word
&ldquo;white&rdquo; is most ingeniously substituted for

to the Latin.&nbsp; The sentiment as really expressed was
probably considered too atrocious for the honesty of the English
character.</p>

<p><a name="footnote32"></a><a href="#citation32"
class="footnote">[32]</a>&nbsp; The reader will see in a moment
that the translation given above is not correct, according to the
ordinary rules of the Latin language.&nbsp; The words
&ldquo;obligare ad aliquid&rdquo; mean &ldquo;to oblige a person
to do a thing,&rdquo; and so the author of the Constitutions has
employed them in the 3d chap. and 5th sec. of the
&ldquo;Examen,&rdquo; where the expression, &ldquo;Obligare ad
matrimonium,&rdquo; is clearly &ldquo;to oblige to
marry.&rdquo;&nbsp; The translation, therefore, which was given
in the first edition, viz., &ldquo;can lead to an obligation to
sin mortal or venial,&rdquo; is undoubtedly correct.&nbsp; But
there are passages in the book, and in some other scholastic
authors, in which the phrase, &ldquo;obligatio ad
peccatum,&rdquo; is employed to convey the idea that the
obligation is of such a character as to render disobedience a
sin; and as it is possible that the phrase may be so employed in
this passage, I have given the version which the friends of the
Society desire.&nbsp; I cannot, however, think that the ordinary
rules of scholarship are to be wholly set aside, or the real
meaning of the words excluded altogether from the translation;
and I am confirmed in this opinion by the reference to the decree
in the index of a copy recently procured, which was published at
Rome in the College of the Society, in the year <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1615, and which may be supposed to
convey the true meaning of the Constitution.&nbsp; In this index
the passage is referred to in the following words:
&ldquo;Superiores possunt obligare ad peccatum in virtute
obedienti&aelig;, quando id multum conveniat.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
natural antecedent of the &ldquo;id&rdquo; is clearly
&ldquo;peccatum,&rdquo; in which case the translation must be,
&ldquo;The Superiors may oblige to sin in virtue of obedience,
when it (the sin) is particularly convenient.&rdquo;&nbsp; If
this be not the meaning, what occasion would there be for the
&ldquo;<i>multum</i> conveniat?&rdquo;&nbsp; But, translated
either way, the decree is so bad, that the question is scarcely
worth discussion.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
